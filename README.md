This repo contains a Datatable that can render a filterable and sortable table. It aims to be very lightweight and easy to use. It has support for retrieving data asynchronously, pagination and recursive searching in relations.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require acfbentveld/laravel-datatables
```

## Whats new
A new method is added since 2.0.11. For large results the search method is very slow. The new `searchable` method fixes that.
By defining wich keys you want to search in, the datatables doens't have to create searchable keys itself wich makes it a lot faster.
```php
    \DataTables::model(new User)
        ->searchable('name', 'description', 'roles.name'); //use the relation name and key
        ->get();
```

## Sample
Below is a simple sample of a table that displays the username of the users inside the `User` model.
First of all. Lets start with the php controller
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Users;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\User;

class UsersController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        //when the datatables makes a request to the same route/method the package will catch this.
        \DataTables::model(new User)->get();
        return view("users.index");
    }
}
```
Then the html with the table
```html
<table id="datatable" class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
</table>
```
And the javascript
```javascript
 $(document).ready(function() {
    //thats all
    $('#datatable').DataTable({
        "processing": true, //process it
        "serverSide": true, //make it server side
        "ajax": location.href, //this will call the the index function in the user controller
        "columns": [ //define the keys
            { "data": "id" },
            { "data": "name" },
        ],
    });
} );
```


## Usage
### php
This package supports 2 methods for building the json data, the first one (not recommended!) is the `collect` method. For this method you pass the retrieved data as a collection to the method. This works great for low amounts of records. 
``` php
DataTables::collect(User::all())->get();
```
The second method (**Recommended**) is the `model` method. This is just great at everything. The datatables class creates a new model instance runs a query on it and done. It also has a lot more options and makes only one request to your database. This is fast for a lot and a low amount of records. Just use this one!
``` php
DataTables::model(new User)->get();
```
### javascript | jquery
You don't have to specify a different url. The package will detect if the datatable makes connection
``` javascript
 $(document).ready(function() {
    //thats all
    $('#datatable').DataTable({
        "processing": true, //process it
        "serverSide": true, //make it server side
        "ajax": location.href //Just get the data from the same url. The package will handle it all
    });

} );
```

### html
At last make a html table. No need to tell you how that works.
``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.datatables.net/v/bs/dt-1.10.16/datatables.min.css"/>

<table id="datatable" class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>name</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
</table>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.datatables.net/v/bs/dt-1.10.16/datatables.min.js"></script>
```

## Options

#### Multiple tables on one page
When using multiple tables on your webpage, you are going to need multiple routes to call the datatables package.
Or you can use the `table` method. 
```php
    \DataTables::model(new User)->table('users')->get(); //will be initialized when the table parameter is users
    
    \DataTables::model(new User)->table('roles')->get(); //will be initialized when the table parameter is roles
```
In your javascript you can call it like this
```javascript
$('#userstable').DataTable({
    "processing": true,
    "serverSide": true,
    "ajax": location.href + '?table=users' //add the table parameter to make it inique
});
```

#### Searchables
It takes some time to create search keys and find the results. If you define the search keys before executing, the datatables will render a lot faster
```php
    \DataTables::model(new User)
        ->searchable('name', 'description', 'roles.name'); //use the relation name and key
        ->get();
```

##### where
Just the regular where method. Use it to filter the model
```php
 DataTables::model(new User)->where('name', 'John Snow')->where('email', 'knows@nothing.com')->get();
```
##### whereHas
Just the regular whereHas method. Use it to filter the model
```php
 DataTables::model(new User)->whereHas('roles')->get();
 DataTables::model(new User)->whereHas('roles', function($query){
   $query->whereName('admin');
 })->get();
```

##### orWhereHas
Just the regular orWhereHas method. Use it to filter the model
```php
 DataTables::model(new User)->whereHas('roles')->orWhereHas('permissions')->get();
```

##### whereYear
Just the regular whereYear method. Use it to filter the model
```php
 DataTables::model(new User)->whereYear('created_at', '2018')->get();
```
##### with
Just the regular with method. Selects the relations with it
```php
 DataTables::model(new User)->with('roles', 'permissions')->get();
```
##### encrypt
Sometimes you want to encrypt a specif value. Like the ID of a model.
``` php
DataTables::model(new User)->encrypt('id')->get(); // will return all items with an encrypted value
```

##### exclude
The exclude method excludes keys from the response data
``` php
 DataTables::model(new User)->exclude('id', 'email')->get(); //removes the id column from the collection
```

##### Scopes
When trying to access scopes from your model, you can use the addScope method to add scopes to your collection.
```php
    DataTables::model(new User)->addScope('active')->get(); //Access the scopeActive on the users model
```
Adding data to the scope
```php
    DataTables::model(new User)->addScope('formatDate', 'd-m-Y')->get(); //Access the scopeFormatDate with data
```

##### with trashed
To retrieve the soft delete items from your database, you can use the default `withTrashed` method.
This will only work on models that have included the soft delete trait.
```php
    DataTables::model(new User)->withTrashed()->get(); //Retrieve the soft deleted items.
```

##### datatable options
``` javascript
 $(document).ready(function() {
    //thats all
    $('#datatable').DataTable({
        "processing": true, //process it
        "serverSide": true, //make it server side
        "ajax": location.href, //Just get the data from the same url. The package will handle it all
        "columns": [ //define the keys
                { "data": "id" },
                { "data": "name" },
            ],
        //if you want to use relations or chage the behavior of a cell
        "columnDefs": [
                {
                    "render": function ( data, type, row ) {
                        //for relations just return the relation key
                        return data.name;
                    },
                    "targets": [0] //the targets, starts at 0
                },
            ],
    });

} );
```
